#  README – Data Directory

This directory contains datasets and resources related to ontology processing.

## Directory Structure

- **ontology_repository/** → Stores the set of ontologies to be processed. These ontologies are used for analysis, evaluation, and generation within the framework.

## Description

Currently, the **ontology_repository** folder contains **three example ontologies** that can be used to test ontology-based tasks. These ontologies serve as a reference for processing and evaluation within the framework.

This repository can be expanded with ontologies from different domains as needed to support additional experiments and evaluations.

---

## Usage

To use the available ontologies in `ontology_repository/`, simply point your scripts to the relevant ontology files. The framework is designed to process and analyze these ontologies to compute relevant metrics.

If additional ontologies are added, ensure they follow the expected format for seamless integration.

---

## Notes

- The current set of ontologies in `ontology_repository/` is provided as an initial reference.
- Future updates may include more comprehensive ontology collections.
- If new ontologies are added, update this README accordingly.
